It is most useful when working with plain-text files, which include data stored in non-proprietary spreadsheet formats, scripts from programming languages and manuscripts stored in plain text formats. For those files, Git can not only save all versions in the history but also highlight the changes between versions. \n",
    "# Secondly, Git can manage datasets, which include data manually entered via spreadsheets, recorded as part of observational studies, or ones retrieved from sensors. Git also works for statistical code and figures. It’s especially useful for finding errors in a complex code file.\n",
